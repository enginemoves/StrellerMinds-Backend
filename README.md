# User Data Retention Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the data retention policies for user accounts within our platform, focusing on how user data is handled during account deactivation and deletion processes. These policies have been designed to comply with privacy regulations while maintaining the integrity of blockchain credentials where necessary.

## Account States

User accounts may exist in one of the following states:

1. **Active** - Normal operational state
2. **Deactivated** - Temporarily suspended but recoverable
3. **Pending Deletion** - Awaiting confirmation for permanent deletion
4. **Deleted** - Permanently removed (soft-deleted with data scrubbing)

## Data Categories

User data is categorized as follows:

### Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

- Full name
- Email address
- Profile picture
- Biography
- Other personal details

### Account Data

- User ID
- Account credentials (password hash)
- Role information
- Account creation and activity timestamps

### Blockchain Credentials

- Wallet address
- Chain ID
- Wallet type
- Associated blockchain credentials

### Activity Data

- Learning progress
- Course completion records
- Transaction history (if applicable)

## Retention Periods

| Data Category          | Active Account | Deactivated Account | Post-Deletion                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| PII                    | Retained       | Retained            | Scrubbed immediately                        |
| Account Data           | Retained       | Retained            | Soft-deleted for 30 days, then hard-deleted |
| Blockchain Credentials | Retained       | Retained            | Preserved indefinitely for compliance\*     |
| Activity Data          | Retained       | Retained            | Soft-deleted for 30 days, then hard-deleted |

\* _Retention of blockchain credentials is necessary for compliance with financial regulations and to maintain the integrity of blockchain transactions. These credentials are dissociated from personal information upon account deletion._

## Data Handling Procedures

### Account Deactivation

When an account is deactivated:

- All data is preserved
- Access to the account is suspended
- User can reactivate the account at any time
- Deactivation is logged for audit purposes

### Account Deletion Request

When a user requests account deletion:

1. User must confirm deletion via a secure link sent to their email
2. Account is marked as "Pending Deletion"
3. User has 24 hours to cancel the deletion request
4. Request is logged for audit purposes

### Account Deletion Process

When account deletion is confirmed:

1. Personal identifiable information is immediately scrubbed:
   - Name fields are replaced with "[REDACTED]"
   - Email is anonymized
   - Profile picture and bio are removed
2. Account is soft-deleted and marked as "Deleted"
3. Blockchain credentials are preserved but dissociated from personal information
4. Learning progress data is soft-deleted
5. Deletion is logged for audit purposes
6. Complete data purge is scheduled after the retention period

### Final Data Purge

After the 30-day retention period:

1. All remaining user data is permanently deleted from the system
2. Blockchain credentials are reviewed and retained only if necessary for legal compliance
3. Purge is logged for audit purposes

## Compliance Considerations

This data retention policy is designed to comply with:

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Other applicable privacy regulations

The policy provides users with the "right to be forgotten" while maintaining necessary data for legal and operational requirements.

## Audit Trail

All account state changes and data handling operations are logged with:

- Action type
- Timestamp
- User ID (or system identifier for automated processes)
- Details of the action performed

Audit logs are retained for a minimum of 2 years for compliance purposes.

## Special Considerations for Blockchain Data

Due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology:

- Transactions recorded on the blockchain cannot be removed
- Wallet addresses and public keys remain on the blockchain
- Our system preserves the minimum necessary information to maintain blockchain integrity
- All preserved blockchain data is dissociated from personal information

## Policy Review

This data retention policy is reviewed annually and updated as necessary to comply with evolving regulations and platform requirements.

# OAuth Strategy Integration Guide

## Supported Providers

- Google
- Facebook
- Apple Sign-In

## Design Pattern

- All OAuth strategies implement `IAuthStrategy`
- Each is wrapped in an Adapter to conform to internal structure
- Dynamic injection via 'AUTH_STRATEGIES' token
- Strategy selection based on `provider` string

## Flow

1. User hits `/auth/{provider}` → redirects to provider login
2. Callback `/auth/{provider}/callback` is handled
3. User profile is validated, token issued via `AuthService.login`
4. Optionally, credentials can be used to `register` or `link` accounts

## Adding a New Provider

1. Implement provider’s Passport strategy
2. Create Adapter implementing `IAuthStrategy`
3. Register Adapter and Strategy in AuthModule
4. Add new route in AuthController

# API Documentation

The backend provides interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation and supports SDK generation for client integration.

### Swagger UI
- Access the interactive API docs at: `/api` (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api)
- All endpoints, request/response models, and modules are grouped and described for clarity.

### SDK Generation

You can generate client SDKs in various languages using the OpenAPI spec:

#### Generate OpenAPI Spec

```
npm run generate:openapi
```

#### Generate SDK (example using openapi-generator-cli)

```
npx openapi-generator-cli generate -i http://localhost:3000/api-json -g typescript-axios -o ./sdk/typescript
```

Replace `typescript-axios` and output path as needed for your target language.

### Scripts

- `generate:openapi`: Exports the OpenAPI spec to `openapi.json` for SDK generation.

### Automated SDK Release

When you push a version tag in the format `vX.Y.Z`, an automated workflow will:
- Build the backend and generate the OpenAPI spec (`openapi.json`) aligned to your `package.json` version.
- Generate a TypeScript Axios SDK with fully typed models and API clients.
- Publish artifacts to GitHub Releases, and optionally publish the SDK to npm if `NPM_TOKEN` is configured in repository secrets.

Artifacts published in the GitHub Release:
- `openapi.json` (the exact OpenAPI spec used for generation)
- `typescript-sdk-<version>.zip` (generated SDK package)

To consume the SDK from npm:
- Install: `npm install @starkmindshq/strellerminds-sdk@<version>`
- Import and use in your TypeScript/JavaScript project:

```ts
import { Configuration, DefaultApi } from '@starkmindshq/strellerminds-sdk';

const config = new Configuration({ basePath: 'https://api.strellerminds.io', accessToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
const api = new DefaultApi(config);
// Example call
// const result = await api.usersControllerFindAll();
```

Release traceability:
- Each Release includes a direct link to the matching `openapi.json` used for SDK generation.
- The SDK package version matches the backend `package.json` version used for the tag.

## Contributing

Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the **Getting Started** section. Additionally, ensure your code changes do not break the API contract and are reflected in the OpenAPI documentation.
